# Netflix Clone using React and Node.js

This repository contains the code for a Netflix clone built using React and Node.js. The project demonstrates a highly interactive and responsive user interface, mimicking the look and feel of Netflix.

## Features

- **Movie Database API Integration:** The application makes use of an external movie database API to fetch and display movie data, providing users with a realistic Netflix browsing experience.
- **Firebase Authentication:** Firebase Authentication is used to handle user registration and login. This is a robust and secure way of managing user credentials, ensuring that your users' data is safe.
- **Authentication Customization:** There are two versions of authentication - `auth.js` and `login.js`. You can choose the one that suits your use case the best and adjust it to your needs.
- **Modern JavaScript and React Techniques:** The application is built using modern JavaScript features and React best practices. It showcases efficient use of React hooks, functional components, and context API.
